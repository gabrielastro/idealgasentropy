|| Compute the entropy (and a bit more) of an ideal (but not perfect!) H+He gas as in D'Angelo & Bodenheimer (2013)

## Main functions
Total specific entropy (per unit mass) _s_ of the mixture, in units of k_B/baryon:
- stot_proMasse_rhoT(Y, rho, T)        : the main entropy function, but...
- stot_proMasse_rhoT_bystro(Y, rho, T) : ... this is the same but should be faster because repetitions are avoided

More functions:
- deladDAB13_rhoT(Y, rho, T)           : adiabatic gradient (dlnT/dlnP)\_{const s}
- muDAB13(Y, rho, T)                   : mean molecular weight, dimensionless
 
### Conventions
- rho: density,         always in g/cm^3
- T:   temperature,     always in K
- Y:   helium fraction, always dimensionless

## Notes
- Ortho:Para ratio is not treated explicitly: Only the limit T >> T_rot ~ 85 K is implemented currently
- No metals. If there should be metals, adding them to helium offers an approximate treatment.

## Comments
- For most of the relevant rho--T plane, delad from here and from D'Angelo & Bodenheimer (2013), using their functions as implemented in Pluto (Vaidya et al. 2015), agree to better than 5%. However, there are some ~20% differences

- At the lowest pressure of Saumon, Chabrier & van Horn (1995), the gas should be ideal yet there are small piecewise-constant offsets in the entropy. This could be due to a mistake on my part (despite checking and despite the relative simplicity of the equations) or to non-ideal (interaction, not degeneracy) effects being important in SCvH. Their approach is very different from the simple non-perfect ideal gas.

- Some documentation needs to be done... The entropy formula is an "original derivation"; I have not seen it elsewhere but have also not searched, and is relatively easy to derive.
